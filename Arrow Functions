// Objective: Understand and apply arrow functions for concise syntax.
// 1. Define a traditional function that takes a number and returns its square.
function square(number) {
 return number * number;
}
// 2. Rewrite the above function as an arrow function.
let squareArrow = number => number * number;
// 3. Call both functions with the same argument and print their outputs to verify they are the same.
console.log(square(5)); // Traditional function
console.log(squareArrow(5)); // Arrow function
// Exercise: Convert more traditional functions to arrow functions and explore their usage with higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce.
