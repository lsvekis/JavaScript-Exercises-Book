// Objective: Learn to use loops to process and print each element in an array.
// 1. Declare an array named numbers with values from 1 to 5.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// 2. Use a for loop to iterate over the array and print each number.
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
 console.log("Number: " + numbers[i]);
}
// 3. Try modifying the array or the loop to familiarize yourself with looping through arrays.
// Exercise: Modify the loop to print only even numbers from the array.
