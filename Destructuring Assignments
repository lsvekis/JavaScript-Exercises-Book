// Objective: Learn to extract data from arrays and objects using destructuring.
// 1. Destructure an array to extract its first two elements into variables.
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
const [firstColor, secondColor] = colors;
console.log(firstColor, secondColor); // red green
// 2. Destructure an object to extract two properties into variables.
const user = {
 name: "Alex",
 age: 30
};
const {name, age} = user;
console.log(name, age); // Alex 30
// Exercise: Try destructuring nested objects and arrays, and use the rest syntax to capture the remaining elements or properties.
