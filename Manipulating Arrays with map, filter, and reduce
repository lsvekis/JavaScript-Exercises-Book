// Objective: Learn to transform, filter, and accumulate data in arrays.
// 1. Use `map` to convert all names in the array to uppercase.
const names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];
const upperCaseNames = names.map(name => name.toUpperCase());
console.log(upperCaseNames);
// 2. Use `filter` to find all even numbers in the array.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers);
// 3. Use `reduce` to find the sum of all numbers in the array.
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, current) => acc + current, 0);
console.log(sum);
// Exercise: Try combining these methods to perform more complex operations, like calculating the average of only the even numbers in an array.
