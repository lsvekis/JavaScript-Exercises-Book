// Objective: Learn to define classes and use inheritance.
// 1. Define a base class named Animal with a constructor that takes a name and sets it on the instance.
class Animal {
 constructor(name) {
 this.name = name;
 }
 speak() {
 console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
 }
}
// 2. Define a subclass named Dog that extends Animal.
class Dog extends Animal {
 speak() {
 super.speak(); // Call the parent method with super
 console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
 }
}
// 3. Create an instance of Dog and call its speak method.
const dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.speak();
// Exercise: Extend this example by creating more animal subclasses with unique behaviors and test them.
