// Objective: Learn to use template literals for string creation and interpolation.
// 1. Declare variables for a user's name and age.
let userName = "Alex";
let userAge = 30;
// 2. Use a template literal to create a greeting string that includes the user's name and age.
let greeting = `Hello, my name is ${userName} and I am ${userAge} years old.`;
// 3. Print the greeting to the console.
console.log(greeting);
// Exercise: Experiment with template literals to create more complex strings, including expressions and multi-line strings.
