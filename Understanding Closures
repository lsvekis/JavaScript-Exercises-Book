// Objective: Demonstrate how closures can capture and maintain state.
// 1. Create a function that generates and returns a counter function.
function createCounter() {
 let count = 0;
 return function() {
 count += 1;
 console.log(count);
 };
}
// 2. Create a counter function and increment it a few times.
const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // Should print: 1
counter(); // Should print: 2
counter(); // Should print: 3
// Exercise: Create a similar closure that captures more complex state, like an object, and modifies one of its properties.
