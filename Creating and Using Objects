// Objective: Learn to create, access, and modify properties of JavaScript objects.
// 1. Create an object named student with properties: name (string), age (number), and grades (array of numbers).
let student = {
 name: "Alex",
 age: 20,
 grades: [88, 76, 92, 85]
};
// 2. Print the student's name and age to the console.
console.log("Student Name: " + student.name + ", Age: " + student.age);
// 3. Add a new property to the student object named "major" and assign it a value of "Computer Science".
student.major = "Computer Science";
// 4. Write a function that calculates and returns the average grade from the grades array.
function calculateAverage(grades) {
 let sum = 0;
 for (let grade of grades) {
 sum += grade;
 }
 return sum / grades.length;
}
// 5. Call the function with the student's grades and print the average grade to the console.
let averageGrade = calculateAverage(student.grades);
console.log("Average Grade: " + averageGrade);
// Exercise: Try adding more properties and functions to the student object. For instance, add a function to update the student's major.
